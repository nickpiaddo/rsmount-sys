# Web snapshots

----

Snapshots of helpful website, blog, and documentation pages used while building
this project.

A bookmark is useful, but you never know when a site will go dark forever.
Having a local copy is a good remedy to having information disappear overnight.

These tools were essential for collecting copies:

- [Monolith](https://github.com/Y2Z/monolith)
- [SingleFile](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/single-file/)
